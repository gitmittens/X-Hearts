# X-Hearts
Start on one heart, gain a heart every time you die. If you die at 10 hearts you are permanently dead.

Use `/scoreboard players set @s deaths 0` to reset back to 1 heart

Inspired by the X-Life series

## FAQ
**Does this work on a server?**
Yes. Go into your servers folders and go to `world -> datapacks` and put the datapack there. This datapack works multiplayer so play with however many people you would like!
